# lotus-miner
6block lotus-miner community version, which is continuously freely available to the public.

# Recommended
* CPU：AMD 3960X or other models of Ryzen Threadripper
* RAM：256 GB
* SSD：2 TB * 2
* GPU：NVIDIA 2080 Ti
* OS：Ubuntu 18.04

# Minimum
Not tested. If there is any problem, please raise an issue.
* CPU：AMD with SHA extension
* RAM：128 GB
* SSD：1 TB
* OS：Linux

# Features
* After the first start-up, all subsequent operations are automate without any manual intervention.
* The sealing operation is completely completed by the worker. There is no network transmission except the final sealed sector (about 33 GB) back to the miner.
* Automatically find idle workers and start sealing operation.
* After the program exits, it can be resumed when it is started again. If there is an exception, please raise an issue.
* Based on the recommended configuration, it is possible to run 2-3 sectors in a single machine in parallel, with a daily output of more than 200 GB.
* Automatically set environment variable FIL_PROOFS_MAXIMIZE_CACHING.
* Don't use LOTUS_STORAGE_PATH to store files, separating directories.

# Notice
* Make sure there is enough spare RAM before you get started.
* Make sure all your hardware can connect to the Internet.

# Installation
The mining program, necessary libraries, time calibration , GPU driver, swap memory (64 GB) will be installed.
```
# Download
git clone https://github.com/shannon-6block/lotus-miner.git
cd lotus-miner

# Switch to root account
sudo su
# Execute installation
./script/install.sh
# After installation, you can exit and return to the previous account
# If it is the first time installing the GPU driver, reboot is needed to take effect
```

# Setup
Several configurable environment variables can be set according to your needs.
```
# The directory of lotus, miner, worker, and zero-knowledge proof parameters. It is recommended to set them to directories on SSD.
export LOTUS_PATH="$HOME/lotus"
export LOTUS_STORAGE_PATH="$HOME/lotusstorage"
export WORKER_PATH="$HOME/lotusworker"
export FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE="$HOME/filecoin-proof-parameters"

# Set Chinese zero-knowledge proof parameter download source.
export IPFS_GATEWAY="https://proof-parameters.s3.cn-south-1.jdcloud-oss.com/ipfs/"
# Manually download the zero-knowledge proof parameters to the FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE directory, 200GB
lotus fetch-params 32GiB
```

Start lotus.
```
# Check the version
lotus -v
lotus version 0.4.1+git.ee7bdf38

# Start lotus
nohup lotus daemon > ~/lotus.log 2>&1 &

# View logs
tail -f ~/lotus.log

# Generate an account. Need to go to https://faucet.testnet.filecoin.io/ to get test coins and create a miner account.
lotus wallet new bls

# Wait for node synchronized
lotus sync wait
```

Start miner. Need to complete the test coin getting, miner registering, and node synchronization before.
```
# Use miner registration results to initialize miner
lotus-storage-miner init --actor=xxx --owner=xxxxx

# If miner and worker are not on the same machine, you need to configure the miner's IP
# Cancel the comment in front of ListenAddress and RemoteListenAddress and change their IPs to LAN IPs
vi ~/.lotusstorage/config.toml

# Start miner.
# --max-parallel indicates the number of parallel sectors allowed for each worker.
# When there is 256 GB memory, 64 GB swap and 1.4 TB hard disk free space, two sectors can be parallel.
# When there is 128 GB memory, 64 GB swap and 0.7 TB hard disk free space, one sector can be used in parallel.
nohup lotus-storage-miner run > ~/miner.log 2>&1 &

# View logs
tail -f ~/miner.log

# storage attach, which tells the miner where to store the data actually. Please choose directories under hard disks or network disks
lotus-storage-miner storage attach --init=true --store=true /path/to/storage

# View miner information
lotus-storage-miner info
```

Start worker.
```
# If miner and worker are not on the same machine, you need to copy the files of api and token under LOTUS_STORAGE_PATH of miner to LOTUS_STORAGE_PATH of worker

# Optional environment variables
# The following settings will allow the worker to use the GPU to compute PreCommit2.
export FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_COLUMN_BUILDER=1
export FIL_PROOFS_USE_GPU_TREE_BUILDER=1
# The following setting will cause the worker to use the CPU instead of the GPU to compute Commit2.
export BELLMAN_NO_GPU=true
# The following settings will allow the worker to show more detailed logs.
export RUST_BACKTRACE=full
export RUST_LOG=debug

# Start worker, need to add LAN IP
lotus-seal-worker run --address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3456 > ~/worker.log 2>&1 &
# View logs
tail -f ~/miner.log
```

Advanced: worker uses multiple SSD paths for sealing, which will also increase parallel sectors.

Local : (see: https://lotu.sh/en+lotus-seal-worker)
```
lotus-seal-worker run --address 127.0.0.1:2345 --attach /path/to/another/ssd/directory > ~/worker.log 2>&1 &
```

Distant:
```
lotus-seal-worker run --address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3456 --attach /path/to/another/ssd/directory > ~/worker.log 2>&1 &
```

Observe the operation. Executed on the miner machine. commonly used commands are listed as follows.
```
lotus-storage-miner info
lotus-storage-miner storage list
lotus-storage-miner workers list
lotus-storage-miner sectors list
```

Or you can use the block explorer, like https://filfox.io/, to check it.

If any sector has error, you can check out the sector log for the reason of the error. Or simply remove the sector. Take sector 0 as an example.
```
lotus-storage-miner sectors status --log 0
lotus-storage-miner sectors update-state --really-do-it 0 Removing
```

# TODO
* Due to handling too many tasks and lack of resources of the worker, sometimes, part of sectors will stay in the state of SealPreCommit1Failed for a short while, as can be ignored.
* The program runs smoothly under the recommended configuration, and has not been tested in other environments. If you encounter problems, please raise an issue.
* The official code changes will be merged in time.
* Before running, please ensure that available memory and SSD spaces are sufficient.
